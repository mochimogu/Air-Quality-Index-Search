# Personal-Projects
Here are some personal projects that I have completed. 


THIS IS A SIMPLE PROJECT OF SEARCHING A CITY'S AIR QUALITY INDEX. I USED JAVASCRIPT FETCH API TO OBTAIN AN OPEN SOURCE DATA FROM https://aqicn.org/data-platform/tos/
I HAVE NOT CREATED A WORKING WEBSITE BECAUSE OF THE LIMIT TIME I HAVE WITH SCHOOL WORK BUT I DID FINISHED THAT DESIGN, CODE, AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PROJECT
THERE MAY BE SOME FLAWS BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I AM PROUD TO CREATE. HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND AND MAY BE GIVE SOME FEEDBACKS.
